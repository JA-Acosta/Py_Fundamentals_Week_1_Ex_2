This is the second program derived from 100 program suggested by ChatGPT for a 4 week python course. Since I already have programming expertise, I'll be combining the following six prompts into a single program. My main goal is to pay close attention to pythonic syntax, creating/updating git repositories, and developing good commenting habits. Upon completing this program, I'll push it to github and request feedback from my peers.

The following 6 ChatGPT prompts were used to develop this program:
6. Generate a random number between a specified range.
7. Create a program that swaps the values of two variables.
8. Calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to a given number.
9. Print the even numbers from 1 to a given limit.
10. Determine if a given number is prime or not.
11. Find the factorial of a given number.
